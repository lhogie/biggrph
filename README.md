BigGrph is the second software component of the Cnrs BigGraphs platform, which is a suite of Research tools for the experimentation of distributed algorithms on large graphs. BigGrph itself is discontinued but the platform keeps going through the development of more recent tools.

It consists of the following software developments:
* [Grph](https://github.com/lhogie/grph/) - a high-performance graph library. (discontinued) 
* BigGrph (this page) and its sub-projects - a distributed graph library. (discontinued)
  * [LDJO](https://github.com/lhogie/ldjo/) - a framework for distributed data structures. (discontinued)
  * [Octojus](https://github.com/lhogie/octojus/) - RPC middleware. (discontinued)
  * [Jacaboo](https://github.com/lhogie/jacaboo/) - a Java application deployer/bootstrapper. (discontinued)
* [JMaxGraph](https://github.com/lhogie/jmaxgraph/) a library for centralized graph HPC.
